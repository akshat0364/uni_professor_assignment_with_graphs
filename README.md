# University Course Assignment System Optimization

Find report [here](Report/application_of_graph_report.pdf).

## Problem Statement

The University Course Assignment System Optimization project addresses the challenge of optimizing course assignments for faculty members within a university department. The problem involves categorizing faculty members into distinct groups and assigning them courses based on their preferences and category-based constraints.It is a real world problem and shows how graphs can be used to tackle such real world problems.

### Problem Details

- Faculty members are categorized into three groups: x1, x2, and x3.
- Each category has different course loads: x1 handles 0.5 courses per semester, x2 handles 1 course per semester, and x3 handles 1.5 courses per semester.
- Faculty members can take multiple courses in a semester, and a single course can be assigned to multiple faculty members.
- Preferences are maintained, with each faculty member having a preference list of courses ordered by their personal preferences.
- Courses can only be assigned to faculty members if they are present in their preference list.

### Objective

The primary objective is to develop an assignment scheme that maximizes the number of courses assigned to faculty members while adhering to their preferences and category-based constraints.

## Modifications and Extensions

The problem allows for potential modifications and extensions, such as adjusting the maximum number of courses for each category of professors or extending the number of professor categories.
